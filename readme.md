# gulp-autoprefixer

The new [gulp-autoprefixer](http://git.io/jRtQGg) is out! Adding support for
Autoprefixer v3 and its new API. __Be aware__, this plugin it's being developed
in a new [repo](http://git.io/jRtQGg).

The [v0.0.10](http://git.io/Z1FKgA) has been deprecated and it's no longer
maintained.

If you don't want to migrate, you could still use [v0.0.10](http://git.io/Z1FKgA)
—which supports the old API— at your own risk.
